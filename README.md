As part of my graduate research I tested traditional statistical methods against machine learning in the estimation of mountain lion habitat.

Random forest vastly outperformed the traditional logistic regression method of creating resource selection functions.

I then projected the random forest model to all of North America at 30m resolution.

This map can be used for estimating habitat quality and correlated abundance of mountain lions.
